# 🎲 Dice Roller Extravaganza!

Welcome to **Dice Roller Extravaganza!**, a simple Python program designed to bring the thrill of dice rolling right to your terminal. It’s like having a pair of dice in your pocket, minus the pocket lint and constant fumbling for change.

## 🎯 What Does It Do?

Ever felt the need to roll a die but didn't have one handy? This nifty script has got your back. Here’s what happens when you run the program:

1. **Roll a die**: You press Enter, and a die rolls with a mighty *whoosh* (no sound effects, though).
2. **See the magic**: The program shows you the number you rolled along with some snazzy ASCII art of the die face. Think of it like a fancy visual to accompany your victorious (or not-so-victorious) rolls!
3. **Keep rolling**: If you’re feeling lucky (or persistent), you can keep rolling as much as you want.
4. **Say goodbye**: When you're done (or out of luck), just type 'n', and the program will bid you a fond farewell. No sad goodbyes, just “Thanks for playing!”

## 🧩 How It Works

- **Clearing the Console**: For ultimate dice-rolling clarity, the screen is cleared every time you roll. It’s like wiping the slate clean for your next big moment.
- **Rolling the Die**: The program uses a random number generator to simulate rolling a standard 6-sided die.
- **Displaying the Die**: The rolled number is displayed with some fantastic ASCII art, showing your result in style.

## 🚀 Quick Breakdown of the Code

- **`clear_console()`**: Clears your screen, so each roll feels fresh and crisp.
- **`roll_die()`**: The core of the magic. This function uses Python’s `random` module to generate a number between 1 and 6, simulating the dice roll.
- **`display_die(number)`**: Displays some fabulous ASCII art based on the number rolled. Who needs 3D graphics when ASCII art looks this good?
- **`main()`**: The brain of the operation. It runs the game loop, waits for your input, clears the screen, rolls the die, displays your result, and asks if you want to roll again.


## 🎉 Why You'll Love It

- It's **fun** and **easy to use**.
- Perfect for when you need to settle bets or play a game that requires a die (or if you're just procrastinating).
- It's as simple as pressing Enter, but gives you the satisfying feeling of a real die roll.

Enjoy your virtual dice rolling!
